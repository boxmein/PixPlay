##How to compile? (With Eclipse!)
  1. Get the entire source code by either **cloning** or **downloading**.  
  2. Get Eclipse for Java (Regular), if you haven't already.  
  3. Get [Proclipsing for Eclipse](http://code.google.com/p/proclipsing/).  
  4. To export, click the **fancy P icon** left of the test / debug icons and select either **Applet** or **Application**, with the only build configuration there. The finished files will have their own directory in the project root.  
  5. Zip up the contents of the directories, not the directories themselves!  
  (PS. If you haven't got them, add the export directories to **.gitignore**)
